# ArUco-Motion-Detection

Documentation of a process is often cumbersome and time-consuming for the authors. This is also true in the case of [DIY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself) authors and processes. 

This master thesis project aims to support DIY authors in their documentation processes. A tool that automates the collection of information about the tool usage statistics during the DIY processes is proposed. This is done via detecting and tracking the motion of [ArUco markers](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d9/d6d/tutorial_table_of_content_aruco.html#:~:text=ArUco%20markers%20are%20binary%20square,pose%20estimation%20and%20camera%20calibration.) that can be affixed to tools used during the DIY processes. Details such as the the tool usage order, the usage duration, and time-series visualizations of tool usages are generated. Providing such fundamental information about the tools used, can help in giving the authors a head-start their documentation efforts.
