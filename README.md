# ArUco-Motion-Detection

Documentation of a process is often cumbersome and time-consuming for the authors. This is also true in the case of [DIY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself) authors and processes. 

This master thesis project aims to support DIY authors in their documentation processes. A tool that automates the collection of information about the tool usage statistics during the DIY processes is proposed. This is done via detecting and tracking the motion of ArUco markers that can be affixed to tools used during the DIY processes. Details such as the the tool usage order, the usage duration, and time-series visualizations of tool usages are generated. Providing such fundamental information about the tools used, can help in giving the authors a head-start their documentation efforts.
