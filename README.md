# ArUco-Motion-Detection

Documentation of a process is often cumbersome and time-consuming for the authors. This is also true in the case of [DIY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself) authors and processes. 

This master thesis project aims to support DIY authors in their documentation processes. This is done via detecting and tracking the motion of ArUco markers affixed to common tools that could be used during the DIY processes. The tool usage order, the usage duration, and time-series visualizations of tool usages are generated. An automated tool that provides fundamental information such as these about the tool used, can help in giving the authors a head-start their documentation efforts.
