# ArUco-Motion-Detection
A master thesis project to support [DIY]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself)) authors in their documentation processes. This is done via detecting the motion of ArUco markers affixed to common tools and tracking them. These tools could be used in the DIY processes. The tool usage order, the usage duration, and time-series visualizations of tool usages are generated.
